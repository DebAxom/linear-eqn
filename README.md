## Command Line tool:
To use the command line tool using Deno , type:
```
deno run https://github.com/DebAxom/linear-eqn/command-line-tool/main.js
```
## Note: 
For multiplication, use '*' instead of 'x' <br>
For division, use '/' instead of '%' <br>
Use variable 'x' only (lowercase). This is just a prototype. <br>
It can't solve critical problems. <br>
It can solve only linear equations in 1 variable. <br>
Using brackets can break the program. Don't type something like: 2(x+3)=0 <br>
